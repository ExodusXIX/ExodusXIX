Hello, I’m @ExodusXIX, Im an aspiring programmer with zero commitment and the very basic fundamentals, I hope that any endeavors made here serve as lessons for my future self, and though I am a more reticent individual,
It all changes when around games, whether it be as the player or the developer. I hope that I can make some cool things with cool people one day, but until then, it was nice meeting you.
